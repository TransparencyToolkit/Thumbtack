TimelineGen.genTimeline(event) is the method for generating a full timeline. It takes an array of JSON data as input.

TimelineGen.genEvent(startDate, endDate, headline, text) is the method for generating JSON data for an event. It takes a start date, end date, headline, and text for input. All of these are strings.

TimelineGen.parseDate(date) takes a date in the form of string like 2011-11-15 18:05:01 for input and converts it to the format used by TimelineJS. genEvent also calls this.
